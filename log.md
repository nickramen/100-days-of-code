### Day 3: January 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Made a js function to close o delete an image from the preview div. Learned how to read text from an image using Python libraries. Also found out how to run python scripts using PyScript

**Thoughts:** Working with JS on the browser on the localhost is easier than Python :/

### Day 4: January 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working on getting files saved to a local folder. I want to do it that way because I can easily take them from there and do the photo analysis. I'm not sure whether the pictures could be used if I take refer to them while they are saved on the browser memory... Doing it with JavaScript is definetely not an option, I learned today that JS doesn't have access to the local filesystem for security reasons. So... maybe I can make it work with PHP. If not then I will try using a small SQL database.

**Thoughts:** I wish I could tell JavaScript they have my permission to access my local filesystem.
