### Day 4: January 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working on getting files saved to a local folder. I want to do it that way because I can easily take them from there and do the photo analysis. I'm not sure whether the pictures could be used if I take refer to them while they are saved on the browser memory... Doing it with JavaScript is definetely not an option, I learned today that JS doesn't have access to the local filesystem for security reasons. So... maybe I can make it work with PHP. If not then I will try using a small SQL database.

**Thoughts:** I wish I could tell JavaScript they have my permission to access my local filesystem.

### Day 5: January 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today I installed xampp and started working properly with the php files.

### Day 6: January 17, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I was able to save the images into a local folder at the same time I am saving each file with a customized name. The page was reloading whenever I would upload the picture(submit the form). So it is not reloading anymore.
